# Meme-Group
# Assignment

Your group will make an app that satisfies the following user stories. It will be similar to what was completed in Scrimba, but will be done in VS Code and in a group using git:

- A user will see a meme image on page load
- A user can click "refresh meme image" to load a new one
- A user will see a form with two inputs and a submit button
- Inputs will be:
    - top text
    - bottom text
- A user will be able to see a preview of their meme
- A user will be able to add created memes to a list
- A user will be able to delete memes from the list
- A user will be able to edit an existing meme

Warning: The project will be maintained on github. It is suggested you read and watch everything in Resources before starting the project.



1. Do not set the ID from the meme image as the ID for each created meme. This will cause issues if 2 or more memes use the same image. You can either use the index number from the meme list as the ID or use a [UUID generator package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)

Preform an HTTP request to "[https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes](https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes)" to get a list of memes.

### **Working In a group**

- Each team member will contribute code to the git repo
- While you won't have to commit `state` related code to the git repo yourself, you will need to work on `state` related code, maybe with a teammate or two, so that you can talk about what you did in your assessment. If you are working on code related to `state`, make sure you involve teammates who might not otherwise get the chance because they are working on different files. Paired or group programming is prevalent in the industry.
- Use the Level Channel to check in with someone in a later Level, a TA, or an instructor when you're beginning to help with setting up your Github collaboratively, if needed
- Group members will use this opportunity to practice Agile/SCRUM
    
    SCRUM is a subset of Agile, which is a development team ideology of how to develop software.  Practicing the standup will help you know what to expect in a software development work place. 
    
    To practice, plan to either: 
    
    - Pair program much of the app together, or
    - Plan out which features everyone will have built by the next Stand Up meeting. Or Both
